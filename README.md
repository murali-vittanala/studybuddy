# HelpBuddy Forum (Conceptulaised by Roshni Vittanala - Anderson Junior College - Singapore - 2023)

This is a simple forum web application built in Flask framework in Python.
The idea is for students to interact with each other mainly to get help on different study topics.

## Features

* Add accounts
* Listing the topics
* Asking questions and responding with answers
* Like option for topics and answers


In the future, this can be extended by incorporating more features like:

* Security to ensure only Anderson Junior College students can participate
* Notification to user who raised the question, when there are new answers
* Change password 
* Manage categories and limit them
* Providing a search option to search through topics and replies

## Why I made it

I made this forum as part of JC-1 Computing project to apply client side (HTML5) and server side (Python) concepts.
Also, to make a response web application
